# Balance & Design Notes

## Items to Review

### Material Progression Order
**Issue**: Current material order has Bronze > Iron, but historically Iron Age came after Bronze Age because iron is superior.

**Current Order** (Common tier):
1. Iron (statMultiplier: 1.0)
2. Leather (for armor)
3. Bronze (statMultiplier: 1.1)

**Historical Context**: Iron is actually harder and holds an edge better than bronze. Iron Age replaced Bronze Age because it was a superior material.

**Options**:
- Swap iron/bronze order (iron becomes better, historically accurate)
- Keep current order (common in fantasy games for balance)
- Consider the fantasy game convention vs historical accuracy trade-off

**Decision**: Pending review - marked for future consideration
