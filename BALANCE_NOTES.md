# Balance & Design Notes

## Items to Review

### Material Progression Order
**Issue**: Current material order has Bronze > Iron, but historically Iron Age came after Bronze Age because iron is superior.

**Current Order** (Common tier):
1. Iron (statMultiplier: 1.0)
2. Leather (for armor)
3. Bronze (statMultiplier: 1.1)

**Historical Context**: Iron is actually harder and holds an edge better than bronze. Iron Age replaced Bronze Age because it was a superior material.

**Options**:
- Swap iron/bronze order (iron becomes better, historically accurate)
- Keep current order (common in fantasy games for balance)
- Consider the fantasy game convention vs historical accuracy trade-off

**Decision**: Pending review - marked for future consideration

## Future Design Ideas

### Zone Effects & Environmental Bosses
**Concept**: Add persistent zone effects that modify gameplay and introduce themed environmental challenges.

**The Storm Zone**:
- Environmental effect: "The Great Storm" - a primal, world-ending tempest that has existed since before memory
- Constant wind/lightning damage over time
- Reduced visibility/accuracy
- Chance for sudden electrical discharges
- Boss encounter: A manifestation or avatar of the storm itself
- Narrative hook: Ancient texts speak of a storm that has raged since the world's creation, growing stronger with each passing age

**Other Zone Ideas**:
- Temporal flux zones (time distortion)
- Reality-thin areas (dimensional bleeding)
- Necromantic plague zones (undead corruption)
- Primordial chaos pockets (reality instability)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Zone effects could stack with boss mechanics
- Could replace or complement existing zone bosses (Floor 50 candidate?)
- Atmospheric descriptions should hint at cosmic/primordial scale without explicit explanation
